      <Value><![CDATA[<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>1. Coding can help you understand technology</strong></p>
<p>Technology is everywhere in the modern world and continues to develop at an astonishing rate. Coding already plays a key part in this technological evolution and will become increasingly important in light of new robotics and automated technologies. Learning to code will give you the tools you need to go on and be part of shaping the future. This could include roles in <a href="https://www.fdmgroup.com/rpa-developer-roles-and-responsibilities/">RPA</a>, building automated systems for global banks or healthcare organisations, or even helping to improve the tech in self-driving cars - this is just scratching the surface!</p>
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>2. It can enhance problem-solving skills</strong></p>
<p>Coding can help you improve your logical thinking skills by allowing you to see problems from a new perspective. Complex coding projects are made up of smaller tasks and by breaking down the problem and adopting a methodological way of thinking, you can tackle any challenge. This can be applied to any scenario in both your personal and professional life.</p>
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>3. Coding can be applied to data visualisation</strong></p>
<p>Working with coding languages, such as SQL and Python can provide excellent practice for data analysis and visualisation. These skills are beneficial for designing complex data dashboards and reports, which are vital for making data more accessible and easy to understand. In addition, coding is a skill that can be applied to various roles for data purposes, even outside of the technology industry. Take marketing, for instance: you can use data skills you have learnt from coding to understand performance data or customer trends and use this to inform your marketing strategy.</p>
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>4. Coding can complement creativity</strong></p>
<p>Another benefit of learning to code is that it can help you showcase your creativity online. For example, with coding knowledge, you can create online blogs or complex websites and customise</p>
<p>them to make your own rather than using pre-existing templates. This can be a great way to help you stand out when designing your online portfolio or for creating a strong visual identity for your brand as an aspiring business owner.</p>
<p>Coding can also open up many opportunities for you in more creative fields, such as graphic design, web or app development. Alternatively, coding can be beneficial for non-tech roles if you are a writer and you need to make edits to a blog layout or create an email newsletter or survey, you can use HTML or CSS to do so. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>5. Coding is a universal language</strong></p>
<p>Much like mathematics, code is a universal language; it is the same across the world and does not need to be translated. When transferring jobs or moving to another country, language barriers can sometimes get in the way. However, since coding languages are the same globally, it is a skill you can carry with you to any country. Learning how to code can make you a highly employable individual and give you the ability to thrive in any environment.</p>
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. Coders are part of a community</strong></p>
<p>As a coding enthusiast, there are benefits in joining a programming or coding community. It is an opportunity to share knowledge, advice, and skills with like-minded people. At FDM, we host regular <a href="https://www.fdmgroup.com/femtech-futures-hackathon-fun/">hackathons</a>, events where our consultants can work as a team and code. Some of our hackathons have included working together to program a robot, as well as designing a game from scratch.</p>
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>7. Coding can improve career prospects</strong></p>
<p>Coding is an in-demand skill across industries and offers excellent earning potential with a wide variety of career choices, such as <a href="https://www.fdmgroup.com/rpa-developer-roles-and-responsibilities/">RPA</a>, <a href="https://www.fdmgroup.com/5-reasons-you-should-become-a-software-developer-or-engineer/">Software Development</a> and Technical Operations. Computer Programming also offers vast opportunities for career progression into managerial and senior positions, allowing you to keep learning on the job and expand your skillset.</p>
<p>Learning coding and programming languages will provide you with numerous benefits and career opportunities. If you’re looking to get started on your journey to code or to launch a career in Computer Programming, check out the <strong><a href="https://www.fdmgroup.com/careers/graduates/technical-graduate-programme/">FDM Technical Graduate Programme</a></strong> for more information.</p>]]></Value>
